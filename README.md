#About this project

 Responsive User Interface: Created an intuitive and visually appealing interface using HTML and custom CSS,
with input forms for user details like Roll Number, Age, Gender, Interests, and Hobbies.

• Interactive Login and Password Recovery: Developed a secure login page using JavaScript, incorporating
real-time validation and a password recovery system that utilizes secret question verification for enhanced security.

• Custom Matching Algorithm: Built an advanced matching algorithm in JavaScript, analyzing shared interests
and hobbies from a JSON dataset to find the “right match” for users in real-time.

• Profile Scrolling and Filtering: Implemented a smooth profile browsing experience, allowing users to scroll through
profiles and apply dynamic filters based on gender, year of study, or specific interests, all powered by JavaScript.

• Engaging Features: Added interactive elements like a “Like Meter,” enabling users to rate profiles, with JavaScript
updating the popularity of profiles in real-time, enhancing user engagement.
